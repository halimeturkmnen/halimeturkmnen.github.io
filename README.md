What Should I Eat Today?
This project is a simple web application that suggests random meal recipes based on user-selected filters.

Features
Users can filter recipes by category (e.g., Seafood, Dessert, Vegetarian) or country (e.g., Italian, Turkish, Japanese).

Each time the "Get a New Recipe" button is clicked, a different recipe is displayed.

If a recipe has an associated YouTube video, it will be embedded for reference.

When the website is first opened, a random recipe is shown by default.

Important Notes
Due to API limitations, filtering by both category and country at the same time is not supported. Users can select one filter while keeping the other set to "Random".
